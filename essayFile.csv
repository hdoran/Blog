"Some of the troubles builders came into play with while constructing the empire state buildings mooring mast, were structure, how it would be built, and how it could physically hold a blimp without being ripped out. One problem was figuring out how to reinforce the mast so that the lead could transfer to the foundation instead of ripping off the top half of the building.",1

"The mood created by the author in the memoroir is gentla and proudness.

The author feels proud of being from Cuba through the whole memoroir. He feel proud of being Cuban by explaining the things he does and things that they share by his culture.

Through the whole memoroir the auther show proudness of wher re he came from, from his parents, country, and his neighborhood.",3
"The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” greatly affect the cyclist. I’m sure that the heat makes the cyclist more thirsty, and heat can also drain energy extremely fast. Being in “the california desert in the middle of June” does not sound like an enjoyable time to be riding a bike. When the cyclist got tired and exhausted from not having any water, I’m sure that riding past all of the empty land had an effect on his attitude. I think that seeing a building made him get excited, and then when he found out that it was nothing more than an abandoned building, his spirits greatly dropped. He probably felt that he couldn’t continue for very much longer simply because all of the buildings he came across were empty, or abandoned. When the cyclist reached the bait store, he probably felt much better, and very relieved to have gotten there before he had a heat stroke.",3
"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, she talked about the obstacles facest when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The three main obstacles was the safety, mother nature and existing laws. One of the greatest obstacle was because of safety. Lüsted states, ""... Never fulfilled its purpose... The greatest reason was one safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Because hydrogen is highly flammable there would be no way that would be safe. The building could catch of fire and be a danger for all. Secondly, nature itself would have an affect on the dirigibles. Lüsted states, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent air currents couldnt allow dirigibles to be on the Empire State Building because you can't have dirigibles with violent air currents. It isnt safe. Lastly, laws was an obstacle the builders had to face: Lüsted's knowledge is, ""The other practical lesson why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The law was a huge obstacle for the builders building the dirigibles. Because you can't build something with it being against the law. Because of safety, mother nature and laws, thats what stop the builders from building the dirigibles.",3
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. The author uses words such as warm to describe things. ""Warm homes"" gives you a happy feeling @CAPS1 two gives you a happy mood overal. It makes you think about how happy the author is knowing they still have their family memories/skills.In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author using many words which set the mood of happiness, like ""warmth of kitchen, humble home, not just scent and music but life and love, gracious neighborhood, and simple house into a home. These choice words used by the author give you a good feeling and put you in a happy mood.",2
"In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting by making him feel worse than he does. The cyclist is lost, has only found dirty water, and is moving on rough ground. The features of the setting are “cool pines and rushing rivers,” however, the cyclist comes to find that the “rushing river” is not so refreshing. He also encounters a terrain change, from flat road to short, rolling hills. There is a sign, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” also the name of the passage with a limit of 55 mph, while the cyclist is only going 12 mph. Ironically, he finds a picture of a boy drinking grape juice at the factory, which cause him to hang his head in misery due to his intense thirst. Finally, he comes to a fish camp, where he encounters the owner who, ironically, tells him he’d be better off using his map.",2
The mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting. The mood created by the author is lifting because it shows that race doesn't matter when it comes to unity or friendship. It is also lifting because Narciso's parents gave up everything and everyone so that their family can live a better life. Another reason why it is lifting is because in the story it talks about how the family doesn't have to neccisarily blood related and can be someone you love and will help you. That is why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting.,2
"The builders of the empire state building ran into a lot of problems involving the dirigibles.  One problem is that there was no easy way to make such a suitable docking station at such a great height, while making it look good.  The other, most main reason/problem with the mast for mooring the dirigibles was just a safety issue.  But a big one.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is extremely flammable.  So, if something were to go wrong with docking the dirigible could catch fire and explode & go down in a densely populated area.  There were a lot of safety and structure issues but they were eventually resolved, (like the fact that large lead weights needed to dangle over the streets to weigh down the back of the dirigible",1
The author put that sentence in the story because she feels that will give her enough time to get the test right and cause she likes geese.,1
The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the road that he was on. He was on a road that had snakes and that the trees where all on the road. The road was like a snake cause it was waved and it had a hug hill that made you go fast and it was hard to star dark because the hill was stipped and know one would ride that hill by if it was a rash than it would have been easier to ride the hill cause than there will be more people these would be some people that are these that can help you if you get hurt. There is also no lights there or if you ride at night then you can’t see where you are going un less you put a light on you bike or himilet then you can ride easier the hill at night. That light there is the features of the setting that affects the cyclist that is going down a hill that know one is there that can help you if you need the help you can get it.,1
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy, loving, content mood. This mood is created by Narciso talking about what a great and happy life his parents made for him. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. It just sounds so happy and loving to me. He also says things like ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extened a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. Thats another example of the loving happy mood in this memoir because hes talking about how people were so helpful and gracious to anyone in need and it makes me feel so happy that people are like that. I really enjoyed reading this memoir because it was all about peoples love toward eachother which set a very happy, light-hearted mood for me.",3
"The mood created by the author was to me appreshiation, and some sympathy. Heres @NUM1 people that gave up their home, job, family, friends in the hope that they can live a better life with their son in @LOCATION1. I have lots of appreshiation because its just another example to show how much our parents love and want the best fer us. I feel some-what bad fer the parents because they came from Cuba, and moved to @LOCATION1. They didn't know the language, they had to learn everything over, and look for a job that would take imagrants. Most jobs dont take imagrents, so the parents had to work hard to support their son. The love and detication that our parents put in to give us the best is unbelievable. The mood set was appreshiation and simpathy for the people in this story.",2
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because on the second paragraph all he talks about how his parents made a simple home very traditional Cuban home, and the very heart was the kitchen. Also ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Also his parents sacrifice a lot to get at the point where there at now. This is why the mood of the memoir is happiness. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.

"In “winter Hibiscus” the author uses hibiscus flower to symbolize beauty in unexpected places, adapting to a new life, and Saeng's home country at the end of the story I think that the author realizes that even though she failed the test, everything is going to be okay. While looking at the hibiscus she remembers her old life, which she loved, and she is reminded of the natural beauty that can be found in a hibiscus flower. In life, I think every one should always remember that even though one @MONTH1 be disappointed at sometime, we have to keep in mind, the fact that life goes on. There will always be another chance, as long as you can find peace and beauty in something good.",2
The problems that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the issues of safety. As said in paragraph @NUM1 the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Also said in paragraph @NUM1 there would be lead weights dangling above pedestrians on the street. one other problem they faced were the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.,3
The concluding paragraph explains her next goal. She had to take a test but failed it. Paid over nineteen dollars for the plant. It reminded her of her old home. She will have confident in the spring because the plant grew to its new home so she will grow to her new home also.,2
"Do you think that something should be taken off the book shelf just it affended someone or you disliked it? I dont just cause you dont like something or you dont approve of the reading material dosent mean it should be taken away. If it was like that @DATE1 than there wouldnt be any reading material or books or magazines.          In my opinion if affends you in some way or another than dont read it. Plane and simple. Because im sure that theres thosands of books, magazines, news papers. ect, thats affends alot of people everyday.     I dont mean to be harsh in any way, thats just the way I feel. This is only my opinion.that how I feel about this situation.",2
"The mood the author used in the memoir is showing how proud their family is. Narciso shows how greatful and proud she is that her parents would change cultures, language, and also find a new job so she could be born in @LOCATION1. The author also shows how close their family is. They have an extended family because they live with their grandparents. Narciso is very proud to live in the family she is, and grateful that her parents did all of that for her.",2
"When the builders of the Empire State Building envisioned leading dirigibles moor at the top, there were some critical flaws. For one thing, a thousand foot dirigible moored to such a small focal point with the wind pressure and its own load would exert enormous pressure on the building's frame (p. @NUM1). This could potentially lead to the building's collapse is due to the strain. Another reason was at such high altitudes, the wind is quite violent and would sway the back of the dirigible over thousands of pedestrians below, which is neither ""... practical nor safe."" (p. @NUM2). If something went wrong, the dirigible could take out another building or worse: fall. A more practical, legal obstacle was a law against the presence of airships over cities. A dirigible mooring to a mast, even at that height, was illegal (p. @NUM3). Therefore, with so many obstacles it was deemed impractical to use the Empire State Building as a high-altitude dock.",3
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the reader compare the girl to the geese and the hibiscus. The geese leave for the. winter and then come back in the spring, however the geese also show how the girl is going to come back and take the drivers test again in the spring. The hibiscus dies off over the winter and starts budding again in the spring, this shows that winter is its weakness. Like the hibiscus the girl overcomes her weakness of not being able to drive by remembering her homeland. The author puts this paragraph at the end of the story so you can see that the girl is like the geese and the hibiscus.",3
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of different reasons. The author wants to show with meaning, that the budding of the hibiscus plant will be symbolic. Ho states, “Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits,” This shows meaning because it is currently a point in time where Saeng has to overcome negative circumstances, and with the plant dead it shows symbolically the meaning of the plant. At another point in the story, Saeng realizes that there is much more meaning to the seasons, Ho states, “Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,” she is realizing that come spring time when the plant will be healthy and budding, she will be able to succeed and become somehow like a new person.",2
"Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1,           Should certain books be removed because some people @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate for their children to see or read? No, I do not think they should be removed. I honestly think all they all should be put in different sections of the library by age.      Like all the children books and magizenes should be in one section. The younge adult and or teen books and magizenes should be in a section by its self. Then the adult books and magizenes should be in their own section. Even the autobiographys and documentories should be in their own section too.      It would make things easier to find the book you are wanting to read. For example, if your a teenage girl looking for a book about a high school girl with a crush on a boy, it'd most likely be in the section for the younge adults.      So yes, the parents that are concerned about their children's viewing of certain books should be able to say something about it. But what if one teenager is looking for a book about a famous person's autobiography for a school project. Even though it includes how they used to be into drugs as a teenager. That person shouldn't have to fail if they can't find it in a library because some concerned parent didn't think it was appropriate.     Like I said the best thing to do is put all the books in subcatagories by age. It would make things was easier and faster to find the book of your selection",3
The author of this story concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that the winters coming things are going to die off then come back next spring. Shes refering to the plant. I think she is basically keeping track of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng is ancious to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new things she @MONTH1 experience.,1
"Well some features might have more than others and the cyclist might have more than others. Also the author faced alot of problems like the lack of water, the poisonous snakes and the condition of the road. So there were many thing that affected the author and the cyclist, when they were on there journey.",2
"In the story the cyclist faced many problems, one of the biggest problems was the terrian that he had to maneuver them. The terrain was hilly, having to go up a hill on a bike is tireing and wears you out faster than flat land would, and making him use more energy. The heat was also unbearable making it harder for him to focus, the cyclist did everything he could to keep consiese while  manuvering threu the terrain and deserted landscape being a huge desert of rolling mountains he pushed forwad, finding no civilization anywhere to get a refill of water. For example, if the terrain wasn’t as hilled then it would of made it easier for him using less energy and less strain on his legs, the heat of the desert beating down on him probably slowed his progress also. Heat will make you move slower and a cyclist moving down a  barnest road with no shade will make the journey seem longer, and imposible. In the end his will and determination got with threw the landscape, so he could get the water he needed to finish his trip",2
"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the mood created by the author is happy.The mood is happy because everyone in the memoir are enjoying their lives and their not worrying about anything. As explained in the memoir, even when @PERSON1 and Rawedia had to start their lives over entirely, they didnt hesitate. Their family were happy, they partied, and as said in paragraph @NUM1, they ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family."" In this memoir Narciso enjoyed his life and looked up to his parents for everything they did for him. In paragraph @NUM2 Narciso exclaimed that he will never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a home, which showed their happiness in this memoir.",2
" The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story  ’’Winter Hibiscus’’ with that paragraph to show Saeng  starting over…’’ In the spring , When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding… connects to her  life, is that she is starting fresh in away. Although she @MONTH1 miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine toothed comb, she is making on effort, and ’’take that test again…’’ By retailing the test she shows that she is not ready to give in to ’’@CAPS1 of loss.’’ and to her grief.

The author concludes with this ending because it because it gives hope. It is like a happy ending to a sad story. It is also her final thought for the story and a good end point.,1
"The setting affected the cyclist mood in the story. The cyclist was riding rough terrain and rolling hills. This made the cyclist feel like his journey was hopeless. When the cyclist arrived at the abandoned @CAPS1 Grape Factory he felt on twist of many. He was extremely thirsty and there used to be a @ORGANIZATION1 build there when the cyclist was a the fock in the road, he thought he could get some water. When this failed the cyclist was even less determined. He felt like the world was against him.",2
