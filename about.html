			    <h2 class="title mb-3">About Me</h2>
			    
			    <p>My name is Harold Doran and I have been working in measurement for 20 years and prior to that worked in K-12 as a teacher and a school principal for 8 years. I have always had a passion for developing tools that statisticians, psychometricians, and data scientists can use to make their work more efficient. It's driven mainly by my own curiosity to explore psychometric and statistical techniques at their core to make sure that I understand them better myself. I often find that the detailed process of writing code reveals much about the methods we routinely use.</p>
			
				<p>I think of software development as part of my artistic expression and use it as my palette to make ideas open and accessible. I think a lot about building scalable computational infrastructure in two ways. First, the algorithms at their core must be efficient and scalable, a topic I have written about <a href =https://hdoran.github.io/Blog/compPsych.pdf target = "blank"> here.</a> Second, we can then scale up our systems using modern computing infrastructures like cloud-based computing and taking advantage of distrbuted computing concepts. My personal opinion is we often focus on the latter and ignore the former. Maybe my biggest passion is music and playing on stage.

			    <h5 class="mt-5">About The Blog</h5>
			    <p>This blog is intended to support the software program I refer to as PACER. It is a personal blog and this remains unaffiliated with my work and professional life and experiences. PACER is a web application available at <a href="https://psycho-metrics.shinyapps.io/metrics/" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>
				
			    <h5 class="mt-5">My Skills and Experiences</h5>
			    <p>I am an R programmer, a python programmer, and I guess I can use the term full stack developer as I also write css, javascript, html, jquery (yikes!), Flask, Shiny, and whatever tools are needed to get a job done. As often as possible, I use existing tools, like bootstrap, so I can focus more on creating instead of developing code, and of course everyone hates writing style sheets, right?</p>
