<center> <h1> Dictionary Problem </h1> </center>

<h2> Problem Statement </h2>
<h3>
<p>
The dictionary problem as stated <a href = "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-break-a-very-expensive-centrifuge/" target = "blank"> here </a> is summarized as:

"Each secret word is randomly chosen from a dictionary with exactly 267,751 entries. If you have this dictionary memorized, and play the game as efficiently as possible, how many guesses should you expect to make to guess the secret word?" <b> The answer is 19. </b>
</p>

</h3>

<h2> Motivating Example </h2>
<h3>
<p>
The solution is motivated by a simple example using a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm" target="_blank"> binary search algorithm </a>. In a simple analogy, I pick a random number from 1 to 15 and ask you to guess the number I am thinking. I will tell you if it's higher, lower, or correct. You first guess the midpoint, 8, which has a \(\frac{1}{15}\) chance of being correct. If the number is higher you can eliminate numbers 1 to 8 (or vice versa if the number is lower) and guess two has a \(\frac{1}{7}\) chance of being correct by focusing on the new region of the sequence (i.e., numbers 9 through 15). If a guess 3 is needed, find the midpoint in the remaining sequence and the success probability becomes \(\frac{1}{3}\). Last, guess 4 (if needed) has only one remaining possible choice, hence the success probability at this point is 1. Using this strategy with a sequence of size 15, you would need a maximum of 4 attempts.
</p>

<p>
So, by iteratively halving the sequence and reducing the search space in the region where the number exists, we continue to improve the probability of success until we ultimately reach a point of certainty.

<h2> Towards a Solution </h2>
<h3>

<!--
<p>
Let \(k\) denote the length of the original sequence and then let \(k^*_n\) denote the revised sequence length after applying an iterative halving strategy at guess \(n\). Then, the probability of being correct on guess 1 for a sequence of length \(k\) is \(\Pr(x|1) = \frac{1}{k}\) and the success probability on revised attempts is then \(\Pr(x|n) =\frac{1}{\textrm{floor}(k^*_n)}\) such that the success probability tends to 1, \(\Pr(x|n) =\frac{1}{\textrm{floor}(k^*_n)} \to 1\). We take the floor given that we're dealing with integers. 
<p>
-->

<p>
Knowing that our success probability tends to 1 using this strategy, finding a general solution requires only that we know how many times we can halve a sequence. A sequence of size \(k\) can be halved \(L\) times as: 
$$
L = \textrm{floor}\left(\frac{\log(k)}{\log(2)}\right)
$$ 
and then the maximum number of guesses needed is \(1 + L\), or initial guess plus remaining number of times the sequence can be halved. Apply this strategy to the dictionary problem in the same manner in which case the solution with a dictionary consisting of 267751 words yields an expected number of guesses:

$$
\textrm{floor}\left(\frac{\log(267751)}{\log(2)}\right) + 1 = 19.
$$

<h2> Problem Statement </h2>
<h3>
<p>
The basketball problem as stated <a href = "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-reach-the-summit-first/" target = "blank"> here </a> is summarized as, "What is the probability that, on any given week, itâ€™s possible to form two equal teams with everyone playing, where two towns are pitted against the third?"</p>

<p>
<b> The general answer is (1/N)^3 * ((N-1)^2 + (N-1))/2 * 3 where N is the number of individuals that show up from each of the three towns randomly. Then, the case with 5 players is a special case of this such that (1/5)^3 * ((5-1)^2 + (5-1))/2 * 3 = .24. </b>
</p>

</h3>

<h2> Motivating Example </h2>
<h3>
<p>
It's easy to see the concept when N = 5 because the number of equal team combinations is small. In this example, we observe 30 possible ways in which equal teams could be created. For example, if 2 members show up from town \(x_1\), then we must have 1 from town \(x_2\) and 1 from town \(x3\) (there is no option where 0 members show up from any town). So, write this as 2;1-1 as notation to mean that 2 members arrive from town \(x_1\) and then the equal team is created when 1 member arrives from town \(x_2\) and 1 more from town \(x_3\). Then, the other possible patterns in this example are 3;1-2, 3;2-1, 4;1-3, 4;2-2, 4;3-1, 5;1-4, 5;2-3, 5;3-2, and 5;4-1, or a total of \(\frac{(N-1)^2 + (N-1)}{2}\) unique combinations. But, since this can be arranged such that any town is the third town, we actually have \(\frac{(N-1)^2 + (N-1)}{2} * 3\) possible equal team combinations.

Since we also assume each outcome is equally as likely (i.e., any number from 1 to 5 might show up), we have a probability of \(p = \left(\frac{1}{N}\right)^3\) to observe this outcome for each of the possible combinations to make equal teams. So in words, it's the probability of the outcome times the number of times an "equal teams" outcome can occur with \(N\) players from 3 towns.

And some R code to run a simulation over K replications of the problem where N is the upper limit on the number of players that might arrive from any given town.

team1 <- sample(N,K, replace = TRUE)

team2 <- sample(N,K, replace = TRUE)
team3 <- sample(N,K, replace = TRUE)
full <- as.data.frame(cbind(team1, team2, team3))
indx <- apply(full, 1, function(x) which.max(x))
result <- sapply(1:K, function(i) sum(full[i, -indx[i]]) == full[i,indx[i]])
table(result)[2]/K
