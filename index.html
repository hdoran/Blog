<h1> Dictionary Problem </h1>

<h3>
<p>
The dictionary problem as stated <a href = "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-break-a-very-expensive-centrifuge/" target = "blank"> here </a> is summarized as:

"Each secret word is randomly chosen from a dictionary with exactly 267,751 entries. If you have this dictionary memorized, and play the game as efficiently as possible, how many guesses should you expect to make to guess the secret word?" The answer is 19.
</p>
</h3>

<h2> Motivating Example </h2>
<h3>
<p>
The solution is motivated by a simple example using a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm" target="_blank"> binary search algorithm </a>. In a simple analogy, I pick a random number from 1 to 15 and ask you to guess the number I am thinking. I will tell you if it's higher, lower. or correct. You first guess the midpoint, 8, which has a \(\frac{1}{15}\) chance of being correct. If the number is higher you can eliminate numbers 1 to 8 (or vice versa if the number is lower) and guess two has a \(\frac{1}{7}\) chance of being correct by focusing on the new region of the sequence. If a guess 3 is needed, find the midpoint in the remaining sequence and guess 3 has a success probability of \(\frac{1}{3}\). Last, guess 4 (if needed) has only one remaining possible choice, hence the success probability at this point is 1. So, using this strategy with a sequence of size 15, you would need a maximum of 4 attempts.
</p>

<p>
So, by repeatedly halving the sequence and focusing on the region where the number exists, we continue to improve the probability of success and will efficiently reach a solution. 
</p>

<h2> Towards a Solution </h2>
<h3>

<p>
Formally, let \(k\) denote the length of the original sequence and then let \(k^*_n\) denote the revised sequence length after applying an iterative halving strategy at guess \(n\).

 we might say that the probability of being correct on guess 1 for a sequence of length \(k\) is \(\Pr(x|1) = \frac{1}{k}\), then (if not correct on guess 1) by halving the sequence, guess 2 has a success probability of \(\Pr(x|2) =\frac{1}{\textrm{floor}(k/2)}\) such that the \(n\)th guess has a success probability that tends to 1, \(\Pr(x|n) = \frac{1}{\textrm{floor}(k/n)} \to 1\). We take the floor given that we're dealing with integers. Finding a general solution requires only that we know how many times we can halve a sequence. A sequence of size \(k\) can be halved \(\textrm{floor}(\log(k)/\log(2))\) times. 
</p>

<p>
Apply this strategy to the dictionary problem in the same manner in which case the solution is initial guess at midpoint + number of remaining times we can continue halving the dictionary with \(k\) words, so in this example, \(1 + \textrm{floor}(\log(267751)/\log(2)) = 19\).
